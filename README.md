# Description
```
Who has never played or seen playing Whack-A-Mole in the playroom, the game where you had to smash the heads of moles constantly coming out of their holes? Probably very few.

Well, this is renewed version of the classic Whack-A-Mole game, where Pumpkin Man lurk quickly, but you have to be faster than them! Try your hand at this game from the old flavor: hit the Pumpkin Man with a hammer, be quick and ready. Always try to hit them when they are out completely: you will earn more points. Do not be fooled by their sweet little face: they are spiteful!

Going forward the Pumpkin Man will become faster, making the game increasingly difficult.


Test your eye to hand (or fingers!) coordination and have fun while youâ€™re at it. Just download it and TRY not to get hooked.
